We'd love you to contribute to our source code and to make our project even better than it is
today! Here are the guidelines we'd like you to follow:

- [Questions and Problems](#question)
- [Issues and Bugs](#issue)
- [Before contributing](#contribute)
- [Working with the code](#working-with-the-code)

## <a name="question"></a>Where to ask Questions?

Questions can be asked in form of issues. Also feel free asking questions to the [maintainers](README.md#maintainers)

## <a name="issue"></a> Found an Issue or Bug?

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to our repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

**Please see the [Working with the code](#working-with-the-code) below.**

## <a name="contribute"></a>How to contribute?

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue with the owners of this repository before making a change. Once owners agree with your proposal, you can follow instructions from the next section to create a Pull Request.
Also first of all search GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. We don't want you to waste time.

## Working with the code

If you want to fix, to add enhancement, or to improve documentation, you need to learn how to work with GitHub, Byndyusoft.MakedLogging code base and contributing rules.

### Cloning

You will need clone the repository to work on the code.

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/Byndyusoft/Byndyusoft.MakedLogging.git
```


### Creating a branch

Branch `master` is protected. To make your change, create a new branch from it. You must pull the `master` branch.

```shell
 git checkout master
 git pull origin master
```

For create new branch, you can do :

```shell
 git branch feature/new_feature
 git checkout feature/new_feature
```

or :

```shell
 git checkout -b feature/new_feature
```

For better understanding why branch is created, branch must respect the naming convention:

- for a feature : feature/#<issue_number>\_short_name_of_feature
- for a bug fix : fix/#<issue_number>\_short_name_of_bug

### Writing code

Now, you can write code. For help you, you can read [README](README.md) or ask [questions](#question). Don't forget to add #<issue_number> to your commit messages for automatically link it with the issue.

### Merging your code

After coding, you can't merge your code to `master` because this branch is protected. To do this, you must create a Pull Request from your branch to `master`.

For accepting, each Pull Request must satisfy the following conditions:

1.  The merge to `master` should not have conflict. You can execute `git rebase origin/master`
2.  Tests are enriched and tests are executed with success
3.  Documentation are enriched
